      <description>I've added a rss bot in a matrix room. Now I can shitpost in rss and it'll be posted in matrix chat
room. Pretty cool, huh?</description>

      <description>Do you remember TCGs like Hearthstone or Magic the gathering? If you combine them with a turn-based
strategy you get Duelyst.
I'm glad to see more and more games getting open-sourced because it can serve as an example for
beginner game developer to learn from.</description>

      <description>Hi. This is my rss-only static microblog. Yeah it's pretty ugly rn, but I'll work on the style
later. Here, I'll post stuff that doesn't have as much info to deserve a full article on the blog.</description>
